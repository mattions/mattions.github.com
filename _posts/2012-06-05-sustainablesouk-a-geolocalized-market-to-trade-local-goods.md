The SustainableSouk was an attempt to create a geolocalized sustainable system, 
where super local producers (urban growers,small farmers) can find super busy 
customers, like students, working people. 

The project was set up with the collaboration of 
[Transition Cambridge](http://www.transitioncambridge.org/) and it was concluded 
in 2015.
