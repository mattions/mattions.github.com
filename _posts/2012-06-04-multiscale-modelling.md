A model can be considered multiscale when one or both these conditions are true: 
(i) the object of the modelling spawns different orders of magnitude in at least 
time or space e.g.: from microseconds (Î¼s) to minutes (min), or from nanometers (nm)
to millimeters (mm); (ii) parts of the model run with different timescales and/or 
with different spatial resolutions, influencing each other through a systematic 
exchange of variables (Weinan and Engquist, 2003).

The result of the simulation is the summa of the different approaches, combined 
together, and cannot be achieved using one part of the model only, or simulating 
them in a disconnected way. All branches of Biology are inherently multiscale. 
Neuroscience as well has also to address multiscale problems, where for example, 
an excitatory release of glutamate can trigger an increase in the Calcium 
concentration, which can then act as second messenger, stimulating complex 
biochemical cascades with timescales spanning from minutes to hours or days. 
Nonetheless, given the wide spectrum of the processes involved, communities have 
focused on one particular domain, the electrical aspect or the biochemical one.

In my Ph.D. I have developed an event-driven algorithm which allows to integrate 
different simulators, optimizing the number of syncs between the two and the time
of the syncing. At the same time I've also developed a multiscale model of a 
Medium Spiny Neuron of the Striatum, with 1504 spine modelled explicitely where 
the plasticity, the strenght of a synapse, is computed as the results of the 
integration between the electrical and the biochemical.

The paper about the project can be found on 
[Plos One](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0066811), 
the code is on [Github](https://github.com/mattions/TimeScales), and the documentation 
is available at [Timescale documentation](http://michelemattioni.me/TimeScales/).
